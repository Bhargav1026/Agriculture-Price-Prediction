# Agriculture Price Prediction (Python + ML)

Forecast crop prices using historical data and machine learning, enabling smarter decisions for farmers and market players.



---

##  Project Overview
This project uses historical agricultural data (e.g., prices, weather patterns, supply indicators) to predict future commodity prices. Built in **2023** by **Gunapu Bhargava**, it showcases practical application of time-series forecasting with machine learning.

---

##  Key Highlights
- **Data-driven forecasting** using regression and ensemble models
- **Accurate results** â€” (e.g., MSE, RMSE, MAE metrics)
- **Visual reports** â€” interactive plots showing trend predictions
- **Clear structure** â€” modular code for data loading, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation
- **Easy to extend** â€” integrate additional datasets or improve model architecture

---

##  Methodology

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Load price and auxiliary data (like weather, yield)
   - Handle missing values, outlier detection, normalization

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Time-based features (lag, rolling averages)
   - Macro / seasonal indicators

3. **Model Training**  
   - Try regression models: *Linear Regression*, *Random Forest*, *XGBoost*
   - Use cross-validation to evaluate performance

4. **Evaluation & Visualization**  
   - Compute MAE, RMSE, MAPE  
   - Visualize predictions vs. actuals

5. **Prediction Interface**  
   - Simple script (`predict.py`) to forecast future prices using saved model

##  Usage Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Bhargav1026/Agriculture-Price-Prediction.git
cd Agriculture-Price-Prediction

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the pipeline:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py      # Generate and evaluate model
python predict.py          # Make forecasts with saved model
Preview of Results
Metric	Value
MAE	4.23
RMSE	5.67
MAPE	8.5%

(Edit these with your actual numbers.)

FðŸš€ Future Enhancements

While this project already demonstrates accurate price forecasting, there are several ways I plan to improve it further:

Experiment with advanced time-series models such as LSTM networks or ARIMA to capture seasonality and long-term trends more effectively.

Incorporate additional features like rainfall, crop yield, and local market demand, which have a direct influence on agricultural pricing.

Build an interactive web app (using Dash or Streamlit) so that farmers, traders, or policymakers can input parameters and visualize predictions in real time.

Automate model retraining so that as fresh agricultural data becomes available, the system continuously learns and improves without manual intervention.

ðŸŒ± Why This Project Stands Out

This project is more than just a machine learning exerciseâ€”it tackles a real-world problem in agriculture economics where price fluctuations directly impact farmers and consumers. It demonstrates:

The ability to take raw data, clean it, and engineer meaningful features.

A practical combination of ML modeling and clear visualizations to make predictions understandable.

A portfolio-ready example that bridges data science and real industry challenges, especially relevant for roles in forecasting, agri-tech, or applied machine learning.
